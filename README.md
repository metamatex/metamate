# MetaMate

MetaMate is an open-source semantic service bus and provides you an api for everything.

This monorepo hosts metamate, metactl, asg and a couple embedded services.

### Installation

#### metamate

To spin up a metamate instance simply run `docker run metamatex/metamate:latest`. It's preconfigured with some sane defaults.

### metactl

`metactl` is MetaMate's cli. It generates sdks and helps you explore the asg.

On osx run `brew install metamatex/taps/metactl`

For all other platforms, please see our [releases](https://github.com/metamatex/metamate/releases)
