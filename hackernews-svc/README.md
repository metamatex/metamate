# hackernews-svc

This service illustrates

The starting point for this service is the `metactl.yaml`. To create a `metactl.yaml` run `metactl init`. The `metactl.yaml` defines sdks to be generated. To generate the sdks run `metactl gen`

This will generate the `gen` folder. It contains all the types and a service interface.
